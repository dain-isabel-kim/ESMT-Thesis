This research paper attempts to answer the following research question:

_What behavioral remarks reveal the antecedents of conflict from the perspective of social networks?_



This paper explores the correlation between the centralization and density of the task interdependent conflict network along with the correlation between the email volume and the task interdependent conflict dyad with the following hypotheses:

H1: The higher number of conflict relationships in groups, the more likely it is to have a centralized conflict configuration network.

H2a: Conditional on a dyad being task interdependent, the lower the level of communication, the more likely the existence of conflict.

H2B: Conditional on a dyad being task interdependent and not having direct communication, the more both alters communicate with common third parties, the more likely they are to have conflict.



In the following paper, Python (Van Rossum & Drake Jr, 1995), a programming language, was used to conduct the data analysis coding and Visual Studio Code, a source code editor, was used to illustrate the graph from the code. 

Several different software libraries, *pandas* (McKinney, 2010), *NumPy* (Harris, et al., 2020), and *NetworkX* (Hagberg, Swart & Schult, 2006) were used to organize and clean, organize, and utilize the data on Python. 

All the codes written can be found in this repository.
